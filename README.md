(Just learning to use GitHub)

Yep, this is me with training wheels.

I'm a pianist-vocalist-composer-arranger who changed careers to copywriting+proofreading a few years ago, but really I wanted to code.
So here I am!

Sincerely hoping to make it into the Makers Academy fellowship programme this year. But even if I don't, I'll keep learning as much and coding as well as I can.
